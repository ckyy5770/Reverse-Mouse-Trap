# Reverse-Mouse-Trap
AI project 1 - Oct.2016
## Brief description
In this project, I developed an AI system that uses visual mental imagery to
reason about the operation of simple Rube Goldberg machines.

## Design a machine
If you have ever played the classic board game
Mousetrap, then you know that no matter who wins,
you can be sure it is the mice who have lost. This time,
for a change, you will be designing a machine that will
set a mouse free—a “reverse” mousetrap.

The basic setup of the machine is drawn in the sample test case.
The machine will begin when a ball (given) drops
through the hole at the top left of the box. The goal is
to lift the gate that is trapping the mouse. (Also please
do not squish the mouse.) Your machine should be
stable (unmoving) until the ball enters.

## Construct a AI system
Then, I constructed an AI system that uses visual “mental imagery” (depictive visual representations)
to reason about how these machines operate.

My AI system successfully passes five different design, from five different people. Test results are in ReverseMouseTrap folder.
